               draft-parikh-ioam-variable-length-field-00

Abstract

   The purpose of this memo is to describe a new option type, called
   Flex Field, for In-Situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance
   (IOAM).  This option type allows one to append variable length data
   in IOAM data along a network path.

1.  Introduction

   In Situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM) is used
   for recording and collecting operational and telemetry information
   while the packet traverses a path between two points in the network.
   [RFC9197] defines the data fields and associated data types for IOAM.
   Currently, every data field (but one) defined in there is of fixed
   length, i.e. 4-octet or 8-octet, the only variable length field in
   that document is for the Opaque State Snapshot (Section 4.4.2.13. of
   [RFC9197]).

   What if a network operator wants to add important variable length
   data, from the nodes along a network path, in an IOAM packet?  This
   memo proposes a new option type for In-Situ Operations,
   Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM) [RFC9197], to address that.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Background and Motivation

   As we had discussed in the previous section, the [RFC9197] talks
   about IOAM data fields and different IOAM nodes types.

   The term "in situ", in IOAM, refers to the fact that the OAM data is
   added to the data packets rather than being sent within packets
   specifically dedicated to OAM.  IOAM (which uses the data plane) is
   used to complement mechanisms, such as Ping or Traceroute (which use
   the control plane).

   Now, many applications, interested in telemetry data across a path
   are not only interested in the entire path's comprehensive telemetry,
   (to paint a more holistic picture), but also in each individual
   node's telemetry.
   For example:

   Individual packet latency of each node, across the path.
      (This might look same like traceroute, but unlke traceroute, we
      could, with this, be getting the data-plane latency)

   Per-interface performance metrics:
      • Microbursts
      • Packet Drops
      • Traffic Rates
      • Congestion
      • Timestamps
      • Path consistencies, etc.

   Sustainable Networking Applications:
      • Carbon-Intensity of each node along the path (And using that as
      an input to applications that attempt to minimize pollution
      attributable to specific networking traffic)
      • Power Utilization of each node along the path, etc.

   And so, as discussed above, using IOAM, which traverses in the data
   plane, we would get an accurate idea of how the above mentioned
   telemetry metrics would look, for actual data plane packets/traffic.

   Now, due to the nature of this field, and how it is designed, it will
   have an upper limit when it comes to "how many nodes (data) can this
   field accomodate (255)", but it should idealy be able to address an
   administrative domain's needs.  And it is and will be both, backwards
   compatible with existing IOAM data field definitions and forward
   compatible for if any new data fields are introduced in the future.

3.  Transport Options for the Flex Field

   So, as discussed above, we will be using XX (undefined)
   [---preferrably the 21st bit, so it's next to the opaque state
   snapshot, for relatively easay processing---] bit for, the IOAM-
   Trace-Type field present in the "Pre-allocated and Incremental Trace-
   Option headers" (Section 4.4.1. of [RFC9197]), to represent the new
   Flex Field defined in this document.

   And, due to the nature of this field, when present, the Node Length
   (Section 4.4.1. of [RFC9197]) present in the IOAM Header, will
   exclude the length of this field.  With this, logic processor will
   know that the actual bits 0-11 are done and can start on the XX bit
   (aka this document) with it's own length.

4.  IOAM Flex Field Option Type

   This section defines the data field for IOAM Flex Field Option Type.
   And like other IOAM Option Types [RFC9197], this field can be
   transported by a variety of transport protocols, including NSH,
   Segment Routing, Geneve, BIER, IPv6, etc.  [RFC9378]

   Length:
      A 24-bit field, which will represent the length of the Flex Field.
      The length field MUST be present and populated with the "number of
      4 octect words" OR "just the general size in bits" in the eintire
      Flex Field, including the header octet word (this will allow us to
      have a lot of data in this field and won't have any problems).
      This field will also let the processing node know till what size
      does the FLex Field goes, so that it won't accidentally consider
      the Opaque State Snapshot Data Field as a part of the Flex Field.

      (--PLEASE DECIDE ON A LENGTB OPTION, EITHER OCTET OR BITS--)

   Hop Count:
      A 8-bit fields to represent the hop count to record the number of
      nodes along the path that successfully processed the Flex Field.
      The encapsulating node MUST set the value to 1, and each
      subsequent node (transit nodes, as well as the decapsulating node
      prior to performing decapsulation) MUST increment its value by 1.
      If the Hop Count at a node exceeds 255, that node MUST set the Hop
      Count to 0 and set Flag 1 ("Node Hop Count Exceeded") to prevent
      further processing of the Flex Field.

   Namespace-ID:
      As discussed in [RFC9197], this is a 16-bit identifier of an IOAM-
      Namespace.  The Namespace-ID value of 0x0000 is defined as the
      "Default-Namespace-ID" (Section 4.3. of [RFC9197]) and MUST be
      known to all the nodes implementing IOAM.
      The Namespace-ID is populated by the encapsulating node and MUST
      NOT be changed by any of the intermediate nodes.  For any other
      Namespace-ID value that does not match any Namespace-ID the node
      is configured to operate on, the node MUST NOT change the contents
      of the IOAM-Data-Fields except for the Namespace Flag (see below)

   Flags:
      Flags are 4-bit in length, which are used to indicate errors,
      which are encountered during the process of populating the data in
      the Flex Field.  Once a flag is set, no further aggregarion occurs
      along the path.  The encapsulating node MUST set the value of
      Flags to 0 upon transmission.  When an intermediate node
      encounters receives a packet in which any of operations on that
      packet; instead, the IOAM data MUST be the Flags are non-zero, the
      node MUST NOT perform further IOAM forwarded as-is unchanged.
      Here's how the flags are defined:
      • Flag  0: 0x0000: Default Flag value.
      • Flag  1: 0x0001: Node Hop Count Exceeded.
      • Flag  2: 0x0010: Length Error.
      • Flag 16: 0x1111: Other error.

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated Title                 April 2025


   Reserved:
      A 12-bit field, reserved for future usage.  The IOAM encapsulating
      node MUST set the value to zero upon transmission.  And IOAM
      transit nodes MUST ignore the received value (unless this field us
      used in a future memo)

   Data:
      This field is the variable length field which will contain the
      actual data that the operator would like to append.
      Now, what gets into this space is dependent on the Namespace
      specific definition that the operator chooses to have inside their
      domain.  As discussed in Section 4.3. of [RFC9197], the
      significance of IOAM-Data-Fields is always within a particular
      IOAM-Namespace and so, this gives the operators flexibility to
      append different types of variable length data for different
      Namespaces.
      Example: IOAM-Namespaces can be used to identify different sets of
      devices (e.g., different types of devices) in a deployment; if an
      operator wants to insert different IOAM-Data-Fields based on the
      device, the devices could be grouped into multiple IOAM-
      Namespaces.

6.  Secutiry Considerations

   As discussed in [RFC9378], IOAM is focused on "limited domains", as
   defined in [RFC8799].  IOAM is not targeted for a deployment on the
   global Internet, which would incur additional considerations such as
   the crossing of Trust Boundaries, authentication of IOAM data, or the
   desire to obfuscate domain internals to outside parties.  The part of
   the network that employs IOAM is referred to as the "IOAM-Domain".

7.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.  [CHECK]

8.  Security Considerations

   This document should not affect the security of the Internet.
